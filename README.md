# Newton's Cradle 
Learn your concepts on the newton's cradle by using this project and trying out this virtual newton's cradle for yourself! 

## What is the Newton's Cradle?
Newton's cradle or Newton's balls, named after Sir Isaac Newton is a device that demonstrates conservation of momentum and energy. 

## Construction 
All the balls are, ideally, exactly the same size, weight, mass and density. Each pendulum is attached to a frame by two strings of equal length angled away from each other.

## Conservation of energy
The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. Energy can, however, change forms, which the Newton's Cradle takes advantage of particularly the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy and vice versa. Potential energy is energy objects have stored either by virtue of gravity or of their elasticity. Kinetic energy is energy objects have by being in motion. 

## Conservation of momentum
Momentum is the force of objects in motion; everything that moves has momentum equal to its mass multiplied by its velocity. Like energy, momentum is also conserved.
